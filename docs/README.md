## Description

`pub` is an *easy-to-use static site generator specifically **designed for independently publishing your Markdown-based written works on the web***. It not only automatically creates a website for your book but *can also generate other popular open formats such as PDFs and EPUBs (WIP)*, which are supported across almost all machines and e-readers.

*`pub` requires minimal configuration*, allowing you to put all your focus on the act of writing itself. These great defaults emphasize user accessibility and widespread compatibility with many systems, letting you produce works that are comfortable to read in with little effort. However, *`pub` is also extremely configurable and extensible*, with an advanced text templating engine that allows

Additionally, `pub` is permissively licensed. With the ability to operate and browse the documentation (WIP) completely offline, and with all your writing and configuration being done locally in open plain-text formats, there is little potential lock-in to a single service/ecosystem of tools.

The upcoming `pub` version 1.0.0 is also committed to not only be backward-compatible but also forward-compatible. Old book projects should be able to be successfully built in the future.
